1. Relative stability - anchored or pegged to the $1.00
   - Chianlink price feed.
   - Set a function to exchange ETCH $ BTC for USD
2. Stability Mechanism (minting) - algorithmic (Decentralize).
   - People can mint stable coins only if they have enough collateral (determined by the code)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto currencies ETH&BTC).
   - wETH
   - wBTC
4. I also want to implement a simple fee for the protocol and a simple interest system for the deposits and dept.
